# Overview
This three-part challenge covers Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis

# Data Modeling
Task: Sketch an ERD for the CSV files using QuickDBD or a similar tool.
Clearly represent table relationships.

# Data Engineering
Task: Create table schemas for six CSV files, including data types, primary/foreign keys, and constraints.
Ensure primary key uniqueness; use composite keys if needed.
Order tables correctly for foreign key handling.
Import CSV data into corresponding SQL tables.

# Data Analysis
Some of the data analysis I did: 

List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.

List department manager details.

List department details for each employee.

List Hercules with last names starting with B.

List Sales department employees.

List Sales and Development department employees.

List last name frequency counts, descending.

# Conclusion
This challenge set out to showcase the use of SQL and test skills in handling and analyzing data. Included are the cvs files used and the code used to query the data.
